Composer Project template for Drupal
====================================

[![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci]

Drupal WxT codebase for `<site-name>`.

## Requirements

* [Composer][composer]
* [Node][node]

## New Project (stable tag)

```sh
# Not Yet Released
composer create-project drupalwxt/wxt-project:4.1.1 site-name
```

## New Project (dev)

```sh
composer create-project drupalwxt/wxt-project:9.1.x-dev site-name
```

## Containers (Optional)

For the (optional) container based development workflow this is roughly the steps that are followed.

> Note: The [docker-scaffold][docker-scaffold] has now been moved to its own repository. Should you wish to use the docker workflow you simply need to run the following command in the site-wxt repository's working directory.

```sh
# Git clone docker scaffold
git clone https://github.com/drupalwxt/docker-scaffold.git docker

# Create symlinks
ln -s docker/docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yml
ln -s docker/docker-compose-ci.yml docker-compose-ci.yml

# Composer install
export COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1 && composer install

# Make our base docker image
make build

# Bring up the dev stack
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

# Install Drupal
make drupal_install

# Development configuration
./docker/bin/drush config-set system.performance js.preprocess 0 -y && \
./docker/bin/drush config-set system.performance css.preprocess 0 -y && \
./docker/bin/drush php-eval 'node_access_rebuild();' && \
./docker/bin/drush config-set wxt_library.settings wxt.theme theme-gcweb -y && \
./docker/bin/drush cr

# Migrate default content
./docker/bin/drush migrate:import --group wxt --tag 'Core' && \
./docker/bin/drush migrate:import --group gcweb --tag 'Core' && \
./docker/bin/drush migrate:import --group gcweb --tag 'Menu'
```
